**DJANGO CHARITY SITE**

In this project I made a functional website with various interesting features, such as:
- Stripe Donations
- Blog with search, category and tag filters
- Custom Information and custom Social Icons

How to run this project:

Firstly, you will need Python, but let's imagine that you already have it.

Secondly, you will need virtual environment
